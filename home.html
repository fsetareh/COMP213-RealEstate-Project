from the purchase of our new home to the selling of our condo. Right from the 
start, she had taken the effort to understand our requirements and what is 
important to us and ensure that our needs are met, where possible.<span lang="en-ca"> 
				Emilia</span> was also 
very quick to respond to and address all our questions and concerns, whatever 
the day or time it was. All in all, we were very pleased to have had her help us 
out and would recommend her to anyone looking to buy or sell their home.<span lang="en-ca">"

				<span id="quote" lang="en-ca">"Emilia</span> was a delight to work with. Her 
professional expertise was delivered in a very informative, honest, prompt, 
efficient, flexible and caring manner. Not only was she warm and engaging but 
her easy laugh and positive attitude helped to make my first time involvement in 
selling a home less stressful--even fun at times! I would highly recommend
